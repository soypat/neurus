# neurus
A repository to show the most basic Neural Network implementation possible with
different functionality/optimizations.
| Complexity | Features      |
|------------|---------------|
|   Level 0  | ~100 line basic building blocks of a neural network demonstration in [`level0.go`](level0.go). Training the neural network is possible with logic in [`level0training.go`](level0training.go). One does not need to train a neural network to use it, which is why these files are split for the most basic level.|
|  Level 1  | *Planned...* |



## Mnist digit image/label database
Mnist database package available for import under [`mnist`](mnist).
![mnist](mnist/3.png).

```shell
go get github.com/soypat/neurus/mnist@latest
```
